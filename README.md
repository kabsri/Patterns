# Patterns
Counting the number of possible unlock patterns on Android.
I wanted to see how many digits a PIN would have to be to be as secure as a 9-point unlock pattern.
Apparently there are about 140000 different unlock patterns do you would need a 6 digit pin to be more secure. \n
EDIT: I used the version of the 9 point pattern where the sequence 2-1-3 is illegal.
But on actual Androids apparently 2-1-3 is legal, it's just that 1-3-2 is illegal.
You can't go from 1 to 3 without going over 2, but if 2 is already taken then you can go from 1 to 3.
